        <h2 class="font-weight-light">Checkout Workflow</h2>
        <p>Carts in Composable Commerce serve a crucial role of binding everything together. The whole checkout process revolves around Carts. When implemented properly, carts can help with the conversion rate and thereby reduce the number of abandoned carts.
        Lifestyle and Home Corp understands the importance of Carts and would like to implement the following related to the Carts:</p>
        <p>Customer should be able to browse through products from a store.</p>
        <p>A new cart, if one doesn’t exist, is created when a customer clicks ‘Add to Cart’.</p>
        <h3 class="font-weight-light">Steps</h3>
        <br/>
        Perform the following programmatically, using the SDK:
        <br/><br/>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
            <li class="list-group-item"><input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" value="" aria-label="...">Get all products available in the store through Product Selections.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" value="" aria-label="...">Create an anonymous Cart for your Store and add products (LineItems) to the cart.</li>
