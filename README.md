## Using Codespace
In case, your local IDE is not set up properly, you can use GitHub Codespace containers as your dev environment. You can either: 
- go to https://github.com/codespaces and create a new codespace. 
- Visit the repository in GitHub and choose Code --> Codespaces --> Create a new Codespace. It will install Java extension package to set up the project.
